## 1. OVERALL PROJECT FRAMING

### Project Title:
**DairySmart AI Client MVP Development: Market Validation & Initial Evolution**

### Overall Vision:
Architect and deliver a strategic, scalable, and technically robust web/mobile MVP that provides real-time animal health insights for farmers. 
This solo-developer initiative aims to validate DairySmart AI's core value proposition and establish pilot readiness with production-grade quality.

### Core Objective (90-Day MVP):
Build a secure, high-quality MVP focused on 1–2 core user journeys that validate the product’s most critical features. 
Enable deployment to pilot farms within 90 days, ensuring API integration, agile iteration, and technical scalability.

### Methodology:
- Structured, results-driven, consulting-aligned execution.
- Solo developer focus, lean documentation, tight feedback loops.
- Prioritized delivery of value in measurable, production-ready increments.

## 3. DETAILED PHASE BREAKDOWN

### Phase 1: Foundation, Scoping & Accelerated Prototyping

#### Sub-Phase 1.1: Scope Finalization & Technical Discovery (Days 1–7)
- MVP requirements locked for 1–2 core user journeys.
- Tech feasibility assessed.
- **Deliverables:** Signed MVP scope, Risk log, Initial tech plan.

#### Sub-Phase 1.2: UI/UX Prototyping (Days 8–21)
- Convert UI designs to functional React/TypeScript prototypes.
- Validate core flows and gather feedback.
- **Deliverables:** Interactive prototype, UI/UX tech feedback.

#### Sub-Phase 1.3: Lean Architecture Blueprint (Days 22–30)
- Finalize system architecture (React + AWS + PostgreSQL).
- Define key APIs (e.g., Insight Engine), DB schema, CI/CD setup.
- **Deliverables:** Technical blueprint, Phase 2 backlog with estimates.

---

### Phase 2: Agile Core Development & Systems Integration

- Full-stack MVP implementation of selected core journeys.
- Integrate computer vision APIs with robust error handling.
- Implement OAuth 2.0/JWT authentication.
- CI/CD setup for dev/staging environments.
- **Deliverables:** Deployed MVP to staging, integrated CV API, active CI/CD.

---

### Phase 3: Testing, Optimization & MVP Deployment

- Support UAT, address bugs, and harden security.
- Deploy to AWS production for pilot use.
- Configure AWS CloudWatch and basic alerts.
- **Deliverables:** Live MVP at pilot farms, test logs, monitoring tools, ops docs.

---

### Post-MVP: Iteration, Scaling & Technical Evolution

- Prioritize feedback-driven feature development.
- Optimize cloud cost/performance.
- Maintain deployment pipeline and documentation.
- **Deliverables:** Updated MVP versions, scalability plan, tech learning reports.

## 4. KEY SUCCESS FACTORS & RISK MITIGATION

### Key Success Factors
- Scope lock of MVP features and UI/UX designs.
- CV model API readiness and SME access.
- Uninterrupted solo developer execution.
- Timely and focused feedback from stakeholders.

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Scope Creep | Formal scope lock, defer new features. |
| AI Model Instability | Early evaluation, mock APIs/fallbacks. |
| Developer Bottleneck | Prioritization, CI/CD automation, clear comms. |
| Delayed Feedback | Product Owner responsible for structured UAT loop. |
