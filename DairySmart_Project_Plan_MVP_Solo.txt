Project Title: DairySmart AI Client MVP Development & Initial Evolution

Overall Vision:
To architect and deliver an impactful, scalable, and technically sound web/mobile application (MVP focusing on core functionality) that provides real-time animal health insights to farmers. 
This involves executing the technical development from prototyping through to production and subsequent iterations, ensuring a robust and innovative solution suitable for a solo developer context.

Core Objective (90-Day MVP):
To rapidly translate product vision into a functional, high-quality MVP (focused on 1-2 core user journeys) for pilot farm deployment within 90 days. 
This will be achieved by agile development, establishing a sound technical architecture, ensuring essential API integration, and readiness for iterative feedback and scaling.

Methodology Note:
This plan adopts a structured, analytical, and results-oriented approach, reflecting strategic consulting principles, adapted for a solo developer's execution. 
Each phase is designed with clear objectives, defined developer responsibilities, lean and measurable deliverables, and a focus on iterative value creation and core technical soundness.

        Objective for Developer: To receive, understand, and clarify the strictly prioritized MVP features. Conduct initial technical discovery to assess feasibility and identify core technical considerations. 
        (Note: Clarity, stability, and timeliness of product-defined MVP scope are critical for solo developer success).

        Developer's Key Focus & Activities:
            - Ingest and review product-defined MVP scope, prioritized features, user stories (focused on 1-2 core journeys).
            - Participate in focused meetings for requirement clarification.
            - Conduct initial technical feasibility assessments for core features.
            - Identify potential technical challenges, dependencies, and areas for technical spikes if absolutely necessary.
            - Familiarize with existing relevant DairySmart technology/assets (scope of familiarization to be defined by priority).
        Key Deliverables:
            - Combined Initial Technical Assessment & Query Log (covering feasibility notes, potential approaches, identified technical risks/dependencies, and clarification questions).

    **Sub-Phase 1.2: UI/UX Translation & Interactive Prototype Development (Approx. Days 8-21)**
        Objective for Developer: To translate incoming UI/UX design mockups for core journeys into functional, interactive prototypes using the defined tech stack (React, TypeScript) and AI coding tools for efficiency. Gather technical feedback for iterative refinement and validate core user experience concepts.
        Developer's Key Focus & Activities:
            - Receive and interpret UI/UX mockups, wireframes, and visual design specifications for 1-2 core user journeys.

            - Implement 1-2 core user journeys and essential interactions for realism.
            - Engage in efficient collaboration with UI/UX designers and product owners for iteration and feedback.
            - Develop high-level conceptual designs for frontend-backend interaction (especially for the "Insight Engine" related to core journeys).
        Key Deliverables:
            - an interactive front-end prototype covering 1-2 core user journeys.
            - Technical feedback on UI/UX feasibility and implementation constraints for the core journeys.

    **Sub-Phase 1.3: Lean Technical Architecture & MVP Execution Blueprint (Approx. Days 22-30)**
        Objective for Developer: To define and document a lean MVP technical blueprint, including core architecture principles, key API contracts (especially for the "Insight Engine"), essential database schema outline, and a prioritized development plan for building the strictly-scoped MVP in Phase 2. 
        (Note: Documentation to be "just enough" for solo developer execution).

        Developer's Key Focus & Activities:
            - Design the core full-stack technical components (React, TypeScript, Python backend, AWS services, PostgreSQL) for the MVP.
            - Define and document essential API contracts (focus on 'Insight Engine' and core MVP data exchange).
            - Design the core PostgreSQL database schema and essential data models for MVP features.
            - Outline basic application security approach (e.g., OAuth 2.0/JWT for core authentication).
            - Identify key AWS services and core configuration strategy.
            - Outline a simplified CI/CD strategy for MVP (e.g., scripts for build and deploy to dev/staging).
